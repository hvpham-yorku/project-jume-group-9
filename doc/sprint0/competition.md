## Why Competitors Have Not Focused on These Users

Most competitors aim to serve businesses that are expanding or already established, which means they build more complex systems to handle larger-scale operations. These systems can be overwhelming or too costly for very small businesses that just need simple inventory tracking.

## What Competitors Would Need to Do

For competitors to better serve our market, they would need to:
- **Make Their Tools Simpler:** Remove unnecessary features and make navigation easier.
- **Lower Their Prices:** Offer plans that are more affordable for small businesses.
- **Focus on Essentials:** Provide basic inventory tracking without adding complex options.

## Conclusion

Current inventory tools like Shopify POS, Odoo, and Fishbowl are effective for growing businesses but can be too complex and expensive for small businesses. Our product is built for small retailers and online sellers, focusing on ease of use, affordability, and essential features. By focusing on this group, we offer a simpler solution for businesses that larger companies have overlooked.
