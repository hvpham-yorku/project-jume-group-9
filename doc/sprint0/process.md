# Process Documentation

## Team Organization
Our team organized itself by assigning clear roles based on each member's strengths. We designated a **Scrum Master** to facilitate discussions and ensure smooth progress, while the rest of the team took ownership of various tasks, including backlog refinement, development, and testing.

## Tools Used
To streamline collaboration, we used:
- **GitHub** for version control and issue tracking  
- **Trello** for managing user stories and sprint planning  
- **Discord** for communication and quick decision-making  
- **Google Docs** for shared documentation  

## Decision-Making Process
Decisions were made through group discussions, ensuring that all voices were heard. When disagreements arose, we used a **majority vote** approach, prioritizing logical reasoning and feasibility.

## Prioritization and Point Estimation
We defined priorities based on:  
- **Business value**  
- **Technical complexity**  
- **Dependencies**  
- **Effort required**  

For point estimation, we used **Planning Poker**, requiring on average **two rounds of voting** to reach a consensus.

## Meeting Frequency
We held **two structured meetings per week**, along with **daily check-ins via Discord** for quick updates.

## Lessons Learned
- **Clearer role definitions** → Ensuring everyone knows their responsibilities improves efficiency.  
- **More structured decision-making** → Using a standardized framework for technical choices can reduce debate time.  
- **Improved backlog refinement** → Defining user stories more precisely minimizes scope creep.  
- **Consistent check-ins** → Frequent but concise updates help maintain momentum and transparency.  

These takeaways will guide our approach in the next phase, improving overall productivity and collaboration.
