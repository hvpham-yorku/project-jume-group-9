# 🏆 Release Planning Meeting (RPM) - Sprint 1

## 📌 **Release Goal**
The goal for Sprint 1 is to establish a **functional authentication system**, implement the **first version of the UI**, and create **the core pages needed for navigation**. This will ensure that we have a structured front-end with working authentication, allowing us to demonstrate a **clickable and navigable prototype** in the Sprint 1 demo.

## 📅 **Sprint Duration**
- **Start Date:** March 6th, 2025
- **End Date:** March 20th, 2025
- **Sprint Duration:** 2 weeks

## 🎯 **Scope for This Sprint**
The following features will be implemented in Sprint 1:

### **1️⃣ User Authentication & Role Management**
- [ ] Implement **User Login & Authentication** (Employee ID & password-based login).
- [ ] Implement **Role-Based Access Control** (Admin, Manager, Employee).
- [ ] Implement **Password Reset Feature**.

### **2️⃣ UI Design & Page Setup**
- [ ] Implement **Initial UI Design** (following mockups/wireframes).
- [ ] Set up **Navigation & Routing** between different pages.
- [ ] Create **core pages**: Dashboard, Products, Orders, Profile, etc.

### **3️⃣ System Architecture Setup**
- [ ] Establish **Frontend Structure** using Next.js and TailwindCSS.
- [ ] Implement **basic UI components** (buttons, forms, cards, etc.).

## 👥 **Participants**
- Max Eskandari
- Erfan Razmand

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (if needed)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **Project Management:** Trello
- **Design & Documentation:** Figma, Draw.io, Markdown Docs

## 🔍 **Sprint Deliverables**
- ✅ Functional login system.
- ✅ UI components and navigation between core pages.
- ✅ Initial UI design implemented based on mockups.
- ✅ System Design Documents (CRC Cards, Architecture Diagram).
- ✅ Sprint 1 Demo Video showcasing implemented features.
- ✅ `sprint1.md`

## 🚧 **Risks & Mitigation Strategies**
| **Risk** | **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Lack of access to API keys | Use mock data until keys are available |
| UI/UX complexity | Start with a minimal version, iterate based on feedback |
| Team availability issues | Assign backup developers for critical features |
| Unfamiliarity with Next.js & Supabase | Schedule internal knowledge-sharing sessions |

## 📢 **Next Steps**
- Finalize `sprint1.md` with task breakdown.
- Assign user stories to team members in Trello.
- Set up initial GitHub repository and branches.
- Begin implementation of authentication and UI setup.
