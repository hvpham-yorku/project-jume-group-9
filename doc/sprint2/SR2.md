- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Successfully set up and used Supabase to power real-time updates and data fetches across pages.
- ✅ **UI Progress**: Major improvements to the Home page UI, including:
  - Pie chart for order summary.
  - Recent activity fetched from Supabase.
  - Weather widget with live data.
  - Sidebar with profile icon and dynamic links.
- ✅ **Daily Standups**: Most team members were consistent with updates and blockers were quickly resolved.
- ✅ **Code Quality**: We made good use of reusable components, Tailwind CSS, and maintained a clean file structure.

## What Could Be Improved ⚠️

- ⚠️ **TypeScript Errors**: Faced multiple issues with implicit `any` types and component typings which slowed down progress.
- ⚠️ **Late Setup**: A portion of commits were delayed into the second week, which could affect workload distribution marks.
- ⚠️ **Initial UI Planning**: Some UI layout decisions were changed mid-sprint, which introduced rework.

## Action Items for Sprint 2 🔧

- 🔧 Establish shared TypeScript interfaces earlier to avoid repetitive `any` type fixes.
- 🔧 Begin component work earlier in the sprint to spread out the workload better.
- 🔧 Finalize UI designs and agree on layout before starting implementation.
- 🔧 Improve commit frequency and record progress consistently in week 1.

## Lessons Learned 📘

• **Real-data UI design** with Supabase made interfaces more dynamic  
• **Clear frontend-backend communication** ensured proper data structure usage  
• **Visual summaries** (activity/orders) significantly improved UX  
• **Earlier TypeScript planning** would have prevented `any` type issues  
• **Finalized mockups** before coding would reduce rework  
• **Live updates** increased perceived system responsiveness
