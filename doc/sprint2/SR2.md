  - Weather widget with live data.

## What Could Be Improved ⚠️

- ⚠️ **TypeScript Errors**: Faced multiple issues with implicit `any` types and component typings which slowed down progress.
- ⚠️ **Late Setup**: A portion of commits were delayed into the second week, which could affect workload distribution marks.
- ⚠️ **Initial UI Planning**: Some UI layout decisions were changed mid-sprint, which introduced rework.

## Action Items for Sprint 3 🔧

- 🔧 Establish shared TypeScript interfaces earlier to avoid repetitive `any` type fixes.
- 🔧 Begin component work earlier in the sprint to spread out the workload better.
- 🔧 Finalize UI designs and agree on layout before starting implementation.
- 🔧 Improve commit frequency and record progress consistently in week 1.

## Lessons Learned 📘

- Designing with real data in mind (using Supabase) helped make the UI more dynamic and relevant.
- Communication between frontend and backend developers is essential for accurate data structure usage.
- Visualizing recent activities and summaries creates better UX for users—this will carry forward into future features.
